          Imagine you are a baby. You are dependent on the people around you to
          provide you with food, protection, and affection. That is not only the
          case for babies, but for all of us.

          Adults too are constantly in need of affection from loved ones, care
          when sick, or guidance in life. Care work for newborns, adults, and
          the elderly is the most important foundation of society. Simply put,
          without care, there is no life.

              Makes sense - children need lots of care work. Let's see how

              <br />

              Mothers complete 13 hours more care work than fathers. That is

              The mother's care hours rise proportionally to the number of

          Oftentimes,

          mothers have been humanities primary carers. Originally, those reasons
          were biological. Only people with the female reproductive system can
          birth, and later breastfeed children. However, after a child's first
          year, there are no biological advantages that make mothers better
          equipped to caring than fathers.

        <p class="introduction-text">
          In our capitalist society, income is directly tied to social power,
          determining how we live, who we live with, and the terms of our
          existence. Maternity should not be an unaffordable luxury that either
          impoverishes women or makes them financially dependent on men. This
          raises a critical question:
          <span class="highlight"
            >Should caregivers be entitled to financial recognition for their
            work?</span
          >
          <br />
          <br />

          Unless care is adequately funded, women will continue to be exploited
          as an unwaged, unnoticed workforce. The culture surrounding work must
          be overhauled to value and respect care work. This includes the
          societal norms around parenting. Caring should be a central aim of
          society, not an afterthought.
          <span class="highlight"
            >This shift is possible. It is a matter of priorities, not
            resources.</span
