          Imagine you are a baby. You are dependent on the people around you to
          provide you with food, protection, and affection. To survive and
          thrive, you depend on care. That is not only the case for babies, but
          for all of us. Adults too are constantly in need of affection from
          loved ones, care from doctors when sick, or guidance in life. Care
          work means looking after the physical and emotional well-being of
          others. Care work for newborns, adults, and the elderly is the most
          important foundation of society. Simply put, without care, there is no
          life.

              Humans provide most care work during their most active years for
              about 21 hours per week.

              <br />
              <br />

              Does everyone care the same? Not really. Let's divide this graph

              Makes sense - children cause lots of care work. Let's see how
              heterosexual parents split that work.

              <br />

              Mothers complete 13 hours more care work than fathers. That is
              equivalent to two hours per day.

          Oftentimes, women are seen as the natural caregiver. After all, since
          the beginning of time, and across many cultures, mothers have been
          humanities primary carers. Originally, those reasons were biological.
          Only people with the female reproductive system can birth, and later
          breastfeed children. However, after a child's first year, there are no
          biological advantages that make mothers better equipped to caring than
          men. The gendered division of care labor nowadays is arbitrary and
          based on social norms. To better understand the nature of mother's
          care work, let's break down her total workload into tasks.

              Most of these tasks are vital for a childs wellbeing and survival.
              Yet this important work is completely unpaid. The problem is that
              care-work is still not appreciated by society.

          We have seen that mothers are the essential force behind raising and
          sustaining the entire human race — if women stop, everything stops.
          This vital work should be a source of power and pride, deserving of
          significant recognition and reward. In reality, mothers' work is
          entirely unpaid. Care work remains invisible, unglamorous, and
          underappreciated, leaving women economically disadvantaged.

          <br />
          <br />

          'Worth' is an opinion, not a fact, and opinions are formed by culture.
          We exist in a wage-dominated, male-centric culture. Historically, a
          small group of wealthy white men held power—men who neither engage in
          nor value care work.

          <br />
          <br />

          This undervaluing of care work extends beyond the home and into the
          labor market. Many domestic care tasks—childcare, cooking,
          cleaning—have paid market equivalents, such as nannies, food servers,
          and cleaners. Let's explore how paid care work in the labor maket
          compares to other work.

              The 1950s were defined by the "nuclear family" model: a married
              couple with children, where fathers worked full-time and mothers
              managed the home.

              Societal expectations and legal discrimination often barred women

              As a consequence, women work more total hours than men.

              <br />
              <br />
              Still, women earn less money because the majority of their labor
              is unwaged.

        <p class="introduction-text">
          In our capitalist society, income is directly tied to social power,
          determining how we live, who we live with, and the terms of our
          existence. Maternity should not be an unaffordable luxury that either
          impoverishes women or makes them financially dependent on men. This
          raises a critical question: Should caregivers be entitled to financial
          recognition for their work?
          <br />
          <br />

          Unless care is adequately funded, women will continue to be exploited
          as an unwaged, unnoticed workforce. The culture surrounding work
          itself must be overhauled to value and respect care work. This
          includes the societal norms around parenting. Caring should be a
          central aim of society, not an afterthought. This shift is possible;
          it is a matter of priorities, not resources.
